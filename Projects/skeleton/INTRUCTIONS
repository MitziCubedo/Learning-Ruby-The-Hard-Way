Using the Skeleton

You are now done with most of your yak shaving. Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

    Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
    Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
    Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.
    Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.
    Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again.
    Start coding.

   $cp -r skeleton ex47
   $ cd ex47
   $ ls
   NAME.gemspec   bin             doc             lib
   Rakefile       data            ext             tests
   $ mv NAME.gemspec ex47.gemspec
   $ mv bin/NAME bin/ex47
   $ mv tests/test_NAME.rb tests/test_ex47.rb
   $ mv lib/NAME lib/ex47
   $ mv lib/NAME.rb lib/ex47.rb
   $ find . -name "*NAME*" -print
